Let me summarize the payloads for our RestAPIs:
– Requests:

LoginRequest: { username, password }
SignupRequest: { username, email, password }
– Responses:

JwtResponse: { token, type, id, username, email, roles }
MessageResponse: { message }
To keep the tutorial not so long, I don’t show these POJOs here.
You can find details for payload classes in source code of the project on Github.
